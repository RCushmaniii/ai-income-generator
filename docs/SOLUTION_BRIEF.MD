# Solution Brief

**Project:** Freelance Income Planner  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

---

## Problem

Freelancers, consultants, and solo founders face a critical challenge: **they don't know what they actually earn.**

### The Income Visibility Gap

Most independent workers can tell you their hourly rate, but few can confidently answer:

- "What will I actually take home this year after taxes and expenses?"
- "Can I afford to take two weeks off?"
- "What happens if I lose my biggest client?"
- "Is my rate high enough to cover my lifestyle?"

### Why Traditional Tools Fall Short

- **Spreadsheets are complex** - Require manual formulas and constant updates
- **Accounting software is retrospective** - Shows what happened, not what could happen
- **Generic calculators are too simple** - Don't account for seasonality, multi-currency, or scenario planning
- **Privacy concerns** - Most tools require accounts and store sensitive financial data

### The Real Cost

Without income clarity, freelancers:

- **Undercharge clients** - Don't account for taxes, expenses, and unbillable time
- **Overcommit** - Take on too much work without understanding capacity limits
- **Lack financial security** - Can't plan for slow months or build adequate runway
- **Make uninformed decisions** - Accept or reject opportunities without knowing the real impact
